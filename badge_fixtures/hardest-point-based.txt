# Tidy Upper

Intended to be quicker ways to chip in a help out, most 15-30min each. Those that are 5-10 min each count as  ⅓  point (i.e. 3 must be done to count as 1 point).  These tasks are generally focused on cleaning inside.  Do work that needs doing (e.g., don’t sweep an already clean floor), and do work for the group as a whole.  It’s a given that you’ll tidy up after yourself :).  The first time you do a task, learn what to do, how to do it and why.  

To earn Tidy Upper, do 5 points worth of tasks.  Earn one Tidy Upper Tab for every 5 points earned thereafter.
